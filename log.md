# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100daysofcode repo and set tasks in Habitica app

**Thoughts** Nothing done except I made a commitment to myself to do this everyday. I already know how to code but want to improve myself with knowledge even more than what I already know.
